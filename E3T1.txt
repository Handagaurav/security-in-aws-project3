# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

One instance was being used to perform an SSH brute force attack and other was being attacked by an SSH brute force attack.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

AWS GuardDuty is used to analyze and process the data from CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs (that are being written to S3), and DNS logs.
These logs will depict many requests being sent from one instance to a specific IP showing that the instance is used for a SSH brute force attack.
The logs will also indicate lots of requests coming to another instance from a specific IP representing that the instance is under SSH brute force attack.
