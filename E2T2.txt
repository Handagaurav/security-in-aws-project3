Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Errors:
1. The security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 and 5000.
2. The default security group of every VPC allows all traffic.
3. TCP port(5000) is accessible on the EC2 Instance.
4. SSH is listening on port 22 on the EC2 Instance.
5. All administrative rights are allowed by the IAM policy.

Recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Fix:
1. Make changes to the inbound rule for each security group to allow ingress from restricted IPs or delete the rule allowing ingress on port 22 and 5000.
2. Add the required rules to other security groups attached to every vpc or else delete all inbound and outbound rules.
3. Close port 22, 5000 and all other unnecessary ports on the EC2 instance.
4. Implement stronger IAM policy with least privilege access role.
