Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

Error: The public and private subnet network ACL rules allow traffic from all ports on each and every port.

Fix: We can use Network ACL rules to diminish the available network connectivity to decrease the traffic that can be sent to and from the subnet. 
Doing this will reduce the ability of malicious actions by an attacker that can be performed against the infrastructure.

# Poor practice 2

Error: Currently instance role policy is set in such a way that all S3 buckets are accessible from the application server publicly.

Fix: Policy should define in such a way that a specific bucket should be accessible without granting access to other buckets.
